# APPLICATION #3: POMODORO TIMER
## Description

This is a basic pomodoro timer. It is the third app I was tasked to build as part of the Software Development Mastermind program.

The expectations for the project are described in [DELIVERABLES](./DELIVERABLES.md).  

The steps I took and other errata are in [PLANNING](./PLANNING.md). I tried my best to have the commits track closely with this document.
